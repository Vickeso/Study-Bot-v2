# Next Steps

## Interactive Quizzes
After studying a topic, users could take a quiz to test their knowledge. The questions could be generated by GPT based on the source material provided to it, as well as check the answers.

## Improved Object Recognition
Currently, the project identifies objects based on color or ARUCo marks. Implementing a more sophisticated object recognition system could improve accuracy and allow for more complex objects.

## Voice Customization
Allow users to change accent or speed of the TTS voice to their liking.
