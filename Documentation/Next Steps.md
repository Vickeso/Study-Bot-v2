# Next Steps

## Improved Object Detection Methods

Create a neural network that can identify objects based on their appearance, rather than their color or ArUco markers. This would allow for more complex objects to be identified.

## Interactive Quizzes
After studying a topic, users could take a quiz to test their knowledge. The questions could be generated by GPT based on the source material provided to it, and it could check the answers.

## Improved Object Recognition
Currently, the project identifies objects based on color or ARUCo marks. Implementing a more sophisticated object recognition system could improve accuracy and allow for more complex objects.

## Voice Customization
Allow users to change accent or speed of the TTS voice to their liking.

## Fun Facts and Follow-up Suggestions
Suggest learning about fun facts or new questions based on the user's last question.

## Remove dependencies on additional modules
Find a way to patch `whisper` so that it does not need `ffmpeg` to be installed separately, or find a module that can do STT conversions with similar accuracy without the need for `ffmpeg`.

## Concurrent thread termination problem
Find a way to stop all threads when the user presses the question button during question processing, or when the program is closed during question processing, without making a mess of the threads.
