# Next Steps

## Interactive Quizzes
After studying a topic, users could take a quiz to test their knowledge. The questions could be generated by GPT based on the source material provided to it, and it could check the answers.

## Improved Object Recognition
Currently, the project identifies objects based on color or ARUCo marks. Implementing a more sophisticated object recognition system could improve accuracy and allow for more complex objects.

## Voice Customization
Allow users to change accent or speed of the TTS voice to their liking.

## Fun Facts and Follow-up Suggestions
Suggest learning about fun facts or new questions based on the user's last question.

## Remove dependencies on additional modules

## Concurrent thread termination problem
Find a way to stop all threads when the user presses the question button during question processing, or when the program is closed during question processing.
