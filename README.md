# Study-Bot

Study-Bot is an open-source project developed by Edumakers from Tecnol칩gico de Monterrey. It is designed to help visually impaired students review their academic course material. It is an AI-powered study companion that incorporates various technologies, including [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper), [GPT-3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5), [Elevenlabs](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/), and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). For testing purposes, sample course material was sourced from [Langman's Medical Embryology](https://www.amazon.com/Langmans-Medical-Embryology-T-W-Sadler/dp/1496383907), a book by Thomas W. Sadler, PhD.

This project is currently under development. So far, it can listen to the user's question, analyze the source material of the topic they want to study, generate an answer, and read it out loud to the user. 

The next step is to incorporate object recognition, so that the user can hold up a physical model related to the topic and ask a question about it. The object recognition will then be used to provide context to the GPT-3.5 model.

## Installation

It is recomended to use [Python 3.9.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-399/) so that the ```whisper``` library can be used without issues. To avoid having to remove your current Python installation, you may want to use a virtual enviroment to use this specific version of Python. To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run Study-Bot, simply run the following command:

```bash
python AudioInteraction/QA_AudioInteraction.py
```
## Technologies Used

Study-Bot relies on the following existing services and technologies:

- **[Whisper:](https://openai.com/research/whisper)** Used for speech-to-text conversion, allowing users to speak their questions to be fed into the GPT-3.5 model.

- **[GPT-3.5:](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5)** Employed for question processing and answer generation.

- **[Elevenlabs:](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/)** Used for text-to-speech conversion, allowing users to hear the answers generated by the GPT-3.5 model.

- **[OpenCV:](https://opencv.org/)** Used for physical object identification, to aid the GPT-3.5 model in answering questions with the added context of what the user is holding.
