# Study-Bot

Study-Bot is an open-source project developed by Edumakers from Tecnol칩gico de Monterrey. It is designed to assist visually impaired students review their academic course material. It is an AI-powered study companion that incorporates various technologies, including [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper), [GPT-3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5), [Elevenlabs](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/), and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). For testing purposes, sample course material was sourced from [Langman's Medical Embryology](https://www.amazon.com/Langmans-Medical-Embryology-T-W-Sadler/dp/1496383907), a book by Thomas W. Sadler, PhD.

## Installation

It is recomended to use [Python 3.9.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-399/) so that the ```whisper``` library can be used without issues. To avoid having to remove your current Python installation, you may want to use a virtual enviroment to use this specific version of Python. To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run Study-Bot, simply run the following command:

```bash
python AudioInteraction/QA_AudioInteraction.py
```
## Technologies Used

Study-Bot relies on the following existing services and technologies:

- **[Whisper:](https://openai.com/research/whisper)** Used for speech-to-text conversion, allowing users to speak their questions to be fed into the GPT-3.5 model.

- **[GPT-3.5:](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5)** Employed for question processing and answer generation.

- **[Elevenlabs:](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/)** Used for text-to-speech conversion, allowing users to hear the answers generated by the GPT-3.5 model.

- **[OpenCV:](https://opencv.org/)** Used for physical object identification, to aid the GPT-3.5 model in answering questions with the added context of what the user is holding.
