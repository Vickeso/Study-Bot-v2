# Study-Bot

Study-Bot is an open-source project developed by Edumakers from Tecnol칩gico de Monterrey. It is designed to help visually impaired students review their academic course material. It is an AI-powered study companion that incorporates various technologies, including [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper), [GPT-3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5), [Elevenlabs](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/), and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). For testing purposes, sample course material was generated using [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt).

This project is currently under development. So far, it can listen to the user's question, analyze the source material of the topic they want to study, detect the physical educational material that they are holding by color, generate an answer, and read it out loud to the user. 

The next step is to create a user interface in the form of a desktop application, and to create a computer vision model that can detect the physical educational material without depending on color, as well as some performance improvements.

## Installation

It is recomended to use [Python 3.9.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-399/) so that the ```whisper``` library can be used without issues. To avoid having to remove your current Python installation, you may want to use a virtual enviroment to use this specific version of Python. To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run Study-Bot, simply run the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py
```
## Technologies Used

Study-Bot relies on the following existing services and technologies:

- **[Whisper:](https://openai.com/research/whisper)** Used for speech-to-text conversion, allowing users to speak their questions to be fed into the GPT-3.5 model.

- **[GPT-3.5:](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5)** Employed for question processing and answer generation.

- **[Elevenlabs:](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/)** Used for text-to-speech conversion, allowing users to hear the answers generated by the GPT-3.5 model.

- **[OpenCV:](https://opencv.org/)** Used for physical object identification, to aid the GPT-3.5 model in answering questions with the added context of what the user is holding.
